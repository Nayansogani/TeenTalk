                Parental pressure is like a hurricane that never leaves and can take other forms such as pressure on sports, music, drama, and even socialisation as well. It takes a severe toll on children’s confidence and approach towards life. Parents must understand that their children are living in a world where they may face racial, sexual, or religious discrimination, body shaming, hormonal challenges, family or financial problems, violence, etc.

                All these concerns contribute to poor academic performance, lack of motivation, social interaction problems, and even self-harm. On top of all this, the stigma behind mental health in our country is another giant that stands high above children. During such circumstances, some parents even go into denial, resorting to statements such as, “My child has no such problems”, “This is just a slump. He/she will get over it”. But how will they “get over it” if they pressure continues to rise until the bottle bursts? Depression is not something that is gotten over with like a rip of a band-aid, it requires months and sometimes even years to heal through constant emotional support from loved ones.
